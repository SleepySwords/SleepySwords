### Hi there
- I have no idea what I'm doing
- I am currently working on a [`rust email cli`](https://github.com/Fishy-Fishes/too_many_emails)
- My [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/SleepySwords/dotfiles)
- Cool site to create [badges](https://shields.io/category/social) like above
- Uses `Apple Reminders` + `Calender` for organisation and [`alt-tab`](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) for replacing the default apple window switcher.
